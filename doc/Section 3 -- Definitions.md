# Definitions

The expression `Sin[x]` is meaningless if there is no definition for `Sin`.

Definitions define the characteristics, implementations, and properties of command invocations.

For example, to define the `Sin` command you would need to specify:
- The characteristics of it requiring a single argument.
- A list of trigonometric identities for symbolic expansion.
- The implementation of interfaces (e.g., numerical implementations, `Derivative[1][Sin] = Cos`.)
